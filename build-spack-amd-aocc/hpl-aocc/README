Steps to run HPL(32x4):

1. Make sure OpenMPI path is set under run_hpl_ccx.sh and xhpl_ccx.sh
2. Set AOCC compiler path under xhpl_ccx.sh
3. Set matrix size under HPL.dat and (P, Q) values to (4, 8) if not set.
4. Copy appfile_ccx_32x4 to appfile_ccx
5. Set OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 under run_hpl_ccx.sh
6. bash run_hpl_ccx.sh

Steps to run HPL(16x8):
